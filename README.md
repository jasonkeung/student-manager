# Student Manager

This was my first Java Swing desktop application from 2016, where I turned a command line interface assignment and integrated it into a GUI. The user is able to create rosters of student and student ID pairs, allowing them to manage students using ArrayLists and file input/output.

## Getting Started

Run StudentManager.jar as an executable Java program to start; no other files are required. If on a Linux machine, make sure Right Click > Properties > Permissions > "Allow executing file as a program" is checked. The other files in the repository are for development purposes and are not needed for normal use of the program.

## Built With

* [Java Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/swing/) - to build the GUI
